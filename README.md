# claw

Haskell libraries for managing command-line options.

Divided in the following fashion:

- [`claw`](/claw): core types and the parser itself;

- [`claw-prettyprinter`](/claw-prettyprinter): `prettyprinter` support for
  composing help documents and displaying parsing failures;

- [`claw-example`](/claw-example): example package showcasing the use of the previous two.
