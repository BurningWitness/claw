# claw

---

Haskell libraries for managing command-line options.

Divided in the following fashion:

- [`claw`](/claw): core types and the parser itself;

- [`claw-prettyprinter`](/claw-prettyprinter): prettyprinter support for
  composing help documents and displaying parsing failures;

- [`claw-example`](/claw-example): example package showcasing the previous two
  together in both runtime and precompiled variations.
